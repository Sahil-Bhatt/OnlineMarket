# ONLINE MARKET
## Developed by : SAHIL MANOJ BHATT

## About the App :

Online Market is a Web App built using MERN Stack(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js)

The app consists of a system where a user can register/login as vendor or a customer.
He/She may list items for sale in the vendor mode, which can be ordered by customers.

Once the minimum available quantity requirement has been fulfilled, the products are marked as ready for dispatch.
The products that are ready for dispatch can be dispatched by the vendor in his/her portal.
A vendor also has the option of cancelling a listed item.

Customers may search for a product by its name and also compare/sort products based on Price and Availability.
They may also edit their order to make it ready for dispatch on the vendor's end.

Lastly, users may also rate and review the products and the vendor, which will be visible to the vendor as well as users intending to purchase goods from the above mentioned vendor.
